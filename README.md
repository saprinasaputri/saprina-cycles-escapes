## Analysis Data Project: Bike Sharing Dataset
## Bussiness Question
1.   What are the bike rental trends in 2011 and 2012?
2.   How does weather condition affect the number of bike users?
3.   What is the comparison of bike renters between casual users and registered users?
4.   Does the season affect bike renters based on casual and registered users?
5.   How do changes in season and weather conditions influence the total bike rentals?
6.   What is the impact of temperature variables (temp and atemp) and humidity (hum) on total bike renters?
7.   What are the patterns of bike rentals on holidays, weekdays, and working days?

# Conclusion
1.   There is a difference between the highest and lowest data in the number of bike rentals in the months of 2011 and 2012. In 2011, the number of rentals peaked in June and reached its lowest point in January, while in 2012, the peak occurred in September and the lowest point remained the same in January. Based on the visualization above, it can be observed that the total number of bikes rented in 2012 is higher than in 2011.
2.   Based on the data visualization using the boxplot, it can be observed that there is a relationship between weather conditions and bike renters. Weather conditions during clear/Partly Cloudy are the most preferred, followed by Misty/Cloudy weather, and lastly, slightly Light Rain/Snow weather is the least preferred.
3.   Both in 2011 and 2012, the number of registered users significantly outnumbered casual users in bike rentals. Their segment (light golden rod yellow) is much larger than that of casual users (skyblue). Additionally, from 2011 to 2012, there was an overall increase in bike rentals for both user types. The number of bikes rented by registered users almost reached 2 million in 2012.
4.   Based on the barplot visualization, it can be inferred that among all seasons, bike users (Casual and Registered) enjoy fall the most, followed by summer, winter, and finally spring.
5.   Based on the plot, it is evident that summer and fall seasons have the highest bike rentals, reaching nearly 6,000 rentals during Clear/Partly Cloudy weather. Conversely, the number of rentals decreases significantly during Light Rain/Snow, winter, and spring seasons, and diminishes further during Misty/Cloudy weather.
6.   Based on the scatter plot, the following information can be obtained:
* The relationship between temp and count shows a positive correlation between the two variables.
* The relationship between atemp and count also shows a positive correlation between the two variables.
* The relationship between hum and count shows a slightly negative correlation, but it is not very significant as the left-leaning is not very apparent.

**In conclusion**, if the temperature (temp and atemp) increases, bike users also tend to increase. However, the influence of humidity is minimal, although it tends to decrease the number of bike users.
7.   Based on the barplot, the following information can be gathered:
*   The number of bike renters is higher on weekdays (Monday - Friday) compared to weekends (Saturday and Sunday). 0 indicates weekends and 1 indicates weekdays.
*   The number of bike renters is significantly higher on regular days (non-holidays) compared to holidays (national).
*   Friday has the highest number of bike renters, while Sunday has the lowest number of bike renters.

The overall bike rental numbers remain relatively stable across the weekdays, with each day averaging around 5000 rentals. Moreover, there is a notable disparity in bike rental percentages between working days and non-holidays. Precisely, 69.6% of bike rentals are recorded on working days, while only 30.4% are on non-working days. Similarly, the majority (97.6%) of bike rentals take place on non-holidays, with a small portion (2.4%) occurring during holidays.
